# Contributing
Mutant Remix welcomes contributions from everyone.

We encourage you to join our communities to discuss the changes you want to make, and to get help if you need it.

- On Discord https://discord.gg/SkM2XppTrR
- On [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) https://rvlt.gg/kcTDntf1

> Open an issue before working on anything! This way we can discuss the changes you want to make and make sure they fit with the project and that somebody else isn't working on the same thing as you. This is to make sure you don't waste your time working on something that won't be merged.

## Contributing with emojis

- Emojis should follow the [design guidelines](https://github.com/mutant-remix/specification)

### Adding new emojis
- Check the [coverage table](#) (WIP) to see what emojis are missing
- Clone the [assets repository](https://github.com/mutant-remix/assets)
- Add your emojis to the `svg` directory and relevant metadata to the `manifest` directory
- Open a pull request with your changes

## Contributing with code
### Setting up the workspace
- Clone the [mutant-remix repository](https://github.com/mutant-remix/mutant-remix) **recursively** to get the submodules
